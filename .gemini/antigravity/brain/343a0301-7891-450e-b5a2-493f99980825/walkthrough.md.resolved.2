# Implement Active Session Screen Walkthrough

## Changes Made

### Dashboard Update
Updated [dashboard_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart):
- Changed "Hotspot Users" quick action to "Active Sessions"
- Updated icon from `Icons.people` to `Icons.devices`
- Changed route from `/hotspot-user` to `/active-sessions`

### Routing
Updated [main.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/main.dart):
- Added import for [ActiveSessionsScreen](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/active_sessions_screen.dart#6-12)
- Added `/active-sessions` route pointing to [ActiveSessionsScreen](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/active_sessions_screen.dart#6-12)

### Active Sessions Screen
The [active_sessions_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/active_sessions_screen.dart) already existed with:
- **Two tabs**: "Online Users" and "Assigned Users"
- **Online Users Tab**: Lists active sessions with disconnect functionality
- **Assigned Users Tab**: Lists assigned plans with online/offline status indicators
- **Disconnect Feature**: Confirmation dialog and API call to disconnect sessions

## Verification Results
