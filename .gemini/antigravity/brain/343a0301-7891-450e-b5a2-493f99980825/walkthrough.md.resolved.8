# GitHub Action Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified

The initial deployment failed because of a **Flutter version mismatch**.

![Failed Workflow](file:///C:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/.gemini/antigravity/brain/343a0301-7891-450e-b5a2-493f99980825/failed_workflow_summary_1764114786844.png)

**Error**: Build step completed in 0 seconds, indicating immediate failure.

## Root Cause

**Workflow Configuration**: Used Flutter `3.24.5`
**Project Requirement**: Uses Flutter `3.38.2`

The version mismatch caused the build to fail immediately.

## Solution Applied

Updated [.github/workflows/deploy-fix-token-storage.yml](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/.github/workflows/deploy-fix-token-storage.yml):

```diff
- flutter-version: '3.24.5'  # Use stable version
+ flutter-version: '3.38.2'  # Match current Flutter version
```

## Deployment Status

✅ **Fix committed**: `a49c60a` - "fix: update Flutter version to 3.38.2 in deployment workflow"
✅ **Pushed to GitHub**: Workflow should now trigger automatically
⏳ **Building**: Check [Actions tab](https://github.com/Josh84-Axe/Flutter_partnerapp/actions) for progress

## Expected Timeline

## Verification Steps
