# Speed/Rate Limit Field Removal - Summary

## What Was Done

Removed speed/rate limit field from BOTH plan creation screens, as speed is already configured in the hotspot profile.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. PlansScreen (Dialog)
**File:** [lib/screens/plans_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/plans_screen.dart)

**Removed:**
- Speed dropdown field (lines 102-115)
- `selectedSpeed` variable declaration
- Speed validation check
- `'speedMbps': extractValue(selectedSpeed)` from data submission

#### 2. CreateEditInternetPlanScreen (Full Screen)
**File:** [lib/screens/create_edit_internet_plan_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/create_edit_internet_plan_screen.dart)

**Removed:**
- `'speedMbps': 50` hardcoded value from data submission

## Result

✅ Both plan creation methods now work identically  
✅ No speed field in either screen  
✅ Speed is configured via hotspot profile (as intended)
