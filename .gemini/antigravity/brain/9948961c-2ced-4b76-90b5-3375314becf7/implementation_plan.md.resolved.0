# Build and Test Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
The goal is to confirm that the Flutter Partner App can be built as an APK and to run functional UI tests on an Android emulator.

## User Review Required
- **Test Plan**: Confirmation on what "Functional UI test Pan" refers to. If it's a specific document or suite that doesn't exist in the `test` folder, I will need to create a basic one or ask for it. For now, I will assume it implies running the existing [widget_test.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/test/widget_test.dart) or creating a new functional test.

## Proposed Changes

### Build Verification
- Run `flutter build apk` to ensure the codebase is compilable.

### Test Execution
- Check for connected devices/emulators.
- If "Functional UI test Pan" refers to a specific missing test, I will create `test/functional_ui_test.dart` covering basic flows (Login -> Dashboard).
- Run `flutter test` or `flutter drive` (if integration tests).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `flutter build apk` should exit with code 0.
- `flutter test` should pass.
