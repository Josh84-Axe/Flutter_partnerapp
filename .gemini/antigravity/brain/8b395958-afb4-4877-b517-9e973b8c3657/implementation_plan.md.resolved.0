# Phone Number Formatting and Validation Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Implement dynamic phone number formatting and validation across the entire application based on the partner's country. Users should see error messages if the number doesn't match the expected format.

## User Review Required
- None at this stage.

## Proposed Changes
### Dependencies
- Check if a phone number formatting library (like `libphonenumber` or `intl_phone_number_input`) is already used or needs to be added.

### Logic
- Create a utility or service to handle phone number formatting and validation based on country code.
- Retrieve partner's country from `AppState` or `AuthRepository`.

### UI Components
- Audit and update all `TextField` or `TextFormField` widgets used for phone numbers.
- Apply input formatters.
- Add validation logic to `validator` properties.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Test with different country codes (if possible to switch or mock).
- Verify formatting happens as user types.
- Verify error messages appear for invalid numbers.
