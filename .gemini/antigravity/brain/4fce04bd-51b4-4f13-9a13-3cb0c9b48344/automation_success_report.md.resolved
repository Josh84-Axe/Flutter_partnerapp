# Automation Success Report

## Overview
The backend automation script ([test/automation_complete.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/test/automation_complete.dart)) has successfully executed all steps. This confirms that the backend API is fully functional for creating configurations, hotspot profiles, internet plans, and assigning plans to customers.

## Execution Summary
**Date:** 2025-11-22
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

### Steps Verified
1.  **Login**: Successfully authenticated as `sientey@hotmail.com`.
2.  **Rate Limit Creation**: Created `RateLimit_<timestamp>` (e.g., 306M/306M).
3.  **Idle Timeout Creation**: Created `IdleTimeout_<timestamp>` (e.g., 306m).
4.  **Validity Period Creation**: Created `Validity_<timestamp>` (e.g., 306d).
5.  **Shared Users Creation**: Created `SharedUsers_<timestamp>` (e.g., 306).
6.  **Router Fetching**: Successfully identified "Tiknet Updated" router.
7.  **Hotspot Profile Creation**: Created `TiknetPro_<timestamp>` linked to the above configurations.
8.  **Internet Plan Creation**: Created `Tiknet_Plan_<timestamp>` linked to the hotspot profile and validity.
9.  **Customer Lookup**: Successfully found customer "Joshua" and identified the correct `customer_id` (2718) vs `record_id` (5).
10. **Plan Assignment**: Successfully assigned the new plan to Joshua.

## Key Findings & Fixes
*   **Customer ID Mismatch**: The `assign-plan` endpoint requires the inner `customer` ID (e.g., 2718) from the customer object, not the outer record ID (e.g., 5). The script was updated to handle this.
*   **Validity Requirement**: The Internet Plan creation requires a `validity` field to be explicitly passed, even if the linked Hotspot Profile has a validity. This was added to the payload.
*   **Build Issue**: The Windows build was previously failing due to `hotspot_partner_app.exe` being locked by a running process. This was resolved by terminating the process and cleaning the build directory.

## Next Steps
1.  **Manual Verification**: Run the newly built Windows app.
2.  **Login**: Log in with `sientey@hotmail.com` / `Testing123`.
3.  **Verify Data**: Check the dashboard and "Assigned Users" section to see the newly created data and assignment.
