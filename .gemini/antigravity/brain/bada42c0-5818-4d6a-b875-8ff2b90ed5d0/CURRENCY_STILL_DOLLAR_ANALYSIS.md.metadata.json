  "summary": "Root cause analysis for why currency still shows $ instead of GH₵. Documents that the code is correct (uses appState.currentUser?.country), but the app is using an old build from before the profile parsing fix. The fix was applied at 12:20 PM and rebuilt at 12:23 PM, but user is testing with old build from 10:17 AM. Solution: User must run the NEW build to see GH₵ currency.",
