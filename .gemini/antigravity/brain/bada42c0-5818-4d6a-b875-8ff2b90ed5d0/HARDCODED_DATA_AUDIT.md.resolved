# Audit Report: Hardcoded Data & Currency Symbols

## Executive Summary
This audit identifies instances of hardcoded currency symbols, mock data generation, and static data lists within the codebase. Addressing these is critical for internationalization, dynamic configuration, and production readiness.

## 1. Hardcoded Currency Symbols
The following files contain hardcoded currency symbols or logic that defaults to specific currencies (primarily USD).

| File | Location | Issue |
|------|----------|-------|
| [lib/widgets/metric_card.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/widgets/metric_card.dart) | Line 81-82 | Hardcoded `$` as fallback and in `NumberFormat`. |
| [lib/utils/currency_utils.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/utils/currency_utils.dart) | Multiple Lines | Hardcoded map of country names to currency symbols (e.g., `'Kenya': 'KSh'`). Defaults to `$`. |
| [lib/utils/currency_helper.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/utils/currency_helper.dart) | Multiple Lines | Similar hardcoded maps (`countryToCurrency`, `currencyToSymbol`). Defaults to `USD` or `$`. |
| [lib/widgets/data_usage_card.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/widgets/data_usage_card.dart) | Line 33, 40, 44 | Hardcoded units `%` and `GB` (localization issue, not strictly currency). |

**Recommendation:**
- Refactor [currency_utils.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/utils/currency_utils.dart) and [currency_helper.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/utils/currency_helper.dart) to fetch currency configuration from the backend or use a robust internationalization library.
- Replace hardcoded symbols in widgets with dynamic formatters based on the user's locale or profile settings.

## 2. Mock Data & Test Artifacts
The following files contain logic for generating mock data or flags to bypass real API calls.

| File | Location | Issue |
|------|----------|-------|
| [lib/services/auth_service.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/services/auth_service.dart) | Line 13, 40, 106 | Generates mock JWT tokens and IDs (`mock_jwt_token_...`, `partner_...`). |
| [lib/providers/app_state.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/providers/app_state.dart) | Multiple Lines | Extensive comments about "FORCE REMOTE API" and bypassing mock data. Contains logic to toggle between mock and real data. |
| [lib/screens/report_preview_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/report_preview_screen.dart) | Line 17, 93 | `sampleData` list used for UI preview. |
| [lib/screens/onboarding/explore_demo_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/onboarding/explore_demo_screen.dart) | Line 23 | Explicit text mentioning "sample data" for demo mode. |
| [lib/services/api/api_config.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/services/api/api_config.dart) | Line 14 | Comments referencing mock data flags. |

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure [AppState](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/providers/app_state.dart#37-1181) logic correctly respects the production environment and doesn't accidentally fallback to mock data.
- Review [auth_service.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/services/auth_service.dart) to ensure mock token generation is strictly unreachable in production builds.

## 3. Static Data Lists
The following files contain hardcoded lists that should likely be dynamic or localized.

| File | Variable | Issue |
|------|----------|-------|
| [lib/screens/registration_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/registration_screen.dart) | `_countries` | Hardcoded list of country names. Should be fetched from API or a standard library. |
| [lib/screens/login_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/login_screen.dart) | `_countries` | Same as above. |
| [lib/screens/partner_profile_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/partner_profile_screen.dart) | `_paymentMethods` | Hardcoded list of payment methods. Should be dynamic based on available gateways. |
| [lib/screens/reporting_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/reporting_screen.dart) | `_reportTypes`, `_generatedReports` | Hardcoded report types. |
| [lib/screens/onboarding/carousel_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/lib/screens/onboarding/carousel_screen.dart) | `_slides` | Static onboarding content. (Acceptable if content is static). |
| `lib/screens/config/*.dart` | `_configs` | Configuration screens (Data Limit, Validity, etc.) use static lists for UI options. |

**Recommendation:**
- Move country lists to a centralized constant file or fetch from an API to ensure consistency.
- Fetch payment methods and report types from the backend to allow for dynamic updates without app releases.
