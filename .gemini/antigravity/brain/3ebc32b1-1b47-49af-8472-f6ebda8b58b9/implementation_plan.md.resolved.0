# Build Flutter Partner App

The goal is to successfully build the Flutter Partner App. This involves installing dependencies, running the build command, and resolving any issues that arise.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> No specific user review required for the build process itself, unless build errors require significant code changes.

## Proposed Changes
No code changes are planned initially. Changes will only be made if build errors occur.

### Build Configuration
- Verify [pubspec.yaml](file:///c:/Users/ELITEX21012G2/antigravity_partnerapp/Flutter_partnerapp/pubspec.yaml) dependencies.
- Ensure local packages (e.g., `tiknet_api_client`) are correctly configured.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `flutter test` to execute existing widget tests.
- Run `flutter build windows` (or `apk`/`ios` if applicable) to verify the build succeeds.
- Run `flutter run -d windows` to verify the app launches.

### Manual Verification
- Launch the app and verify basic navigation works.
